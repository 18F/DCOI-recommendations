# 18F DCOI Review and Recommendations 

## Purpose
This document captures the output from a single specific review and partner recommendations, regarding OMB's *Data Center Optimization Initiative* (DCOI) [OMB M-16-19](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/memoranda/2016/m_16_19_1.pdf). Although it may not represent a complete or comprehensive approach for all agencies, the hope is that this document can inform continued iterations of agency approaches.

### Background

In February 26, 2010, the Federal Chief Information Officer established the *Federal Data Center Consolidation Initiative* (FDCCI) in [a memo](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/egov_docs/federal_data_center_consolidation_initiative_02-26-2010.pdf) to agency Chief Information Officers, indicating the need to reduce the footprint and environmental impact of legacy data centers. In 2012, FDCCI [was updated](https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/egov_docs/cio_memo_fdcci_deliverables_van_roekel_3-19-12.pdf) to provide further implementation guidance, including [FAQs](https://cio.gov/wp-content/uploads/downloads/2012/09/FAQ-May-2012-Update-V1.pdf) and an updated schedule of deliverables under the FDCCI. Under FDCCI initial inventories of federal data centers were taken, and agencies were required to publicly provide regular reports on their consolidation plans and progress. 

Most recently, on August 1st 2016, OMB released updated guidance for federal data center consolidation activities under the updated term *Data Center Consolidation Initiative* (DCOI) that establishes guidances, which supersedes previous FDCCI guidance as amended. 

### Assessments

The DCOI guidance confirms and builds upon other CIO responsibilities, particularly those outlined under the Federal Information Technology Acquisition Reform Act (FITARA) and further clarified through [OMB Memorandum M-15-14: Management and Oversight of Federal Information Technology](https://management.cio.gov/implementation/#OMB-Memorandum-M-15-14).

The highlights outlined below do not represent comprehensive guidance on FITARA and DCOI implementation, but rather point out distinct key areas and activities for CIO's to initiate in order to build a stronger foundation for delivery upon those goals. In addition other Executive Orders, including EO 13514 **since revoked and superceded** by the publication of [EO 13693](https://www.fedcenter.gov/programs/eo13693/).

From our assessment, under DCOI, agencies should focus on the following key execution items:
* A
* B
* C

### Recommendations
Based on the earlier Assessment, agencies should initiate the following activities:
* A
* B
* C

### Next Steps

* A
* B
* C
